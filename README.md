# RPG-Engine (name pending)
###### A command-line RPG engine with a working level editor

This has been my fun side project for a while and it has also served as a GitHub tutorial. I hope I'm doing everything right :)

## Current roadmap before 1.0
- Create a working tags system and events system in game for more complicated level editing
  - Eg. multi-line dialogue or trans-level interaction. Impossible in current app without adding specific new UseActions or Behaviors
- Make it more user friendly
  - This could be a variety of things, but I think testing is the best way to get feedback on this
  - I *need* to flesh out the help command tho.....
- Create documentation for the level editor
  - The game itself has a tutorial, albeit a very weak one at that, but it functions as intended!!!
  - I think having a level editor tutorial in game would be too cluttery for the game (but who knows, it may be a good idea)
  - My thoughts with this are to make a walkthrough tutorial & documentation pages via the wiki page here on GitHub
- Epic demo world
  - I would love to get some ideas. Currently just thinking something to do with submarines.
  - I need to finish the game first, anyways :P
